== 2nd example: write a Material with associated Metadata

We are going to read the code of

- link:https://github.com/kazurayam/materialstore-tutorial/blob/master/src/test/java/my/sample/T02WriteImageWithMetadata.java[my.sample.T03WriteImageWithMetadataTest]

[source, text]
----
include::../src/test/java/my/sample/T02WriteImageWithMetadataTest.java[lines=20..60]
----

At the line (10), we create an instance of `java.net.URL` with a String argument "link:https://kazurayam.github.io/materialstore-tutorial/images/tutorial/03_apple.png[]". You can click this URL to see the image yourself. You should see an apple.

I create a helper class named `my.sample.SharedMethod` with a method `createURL(String)` that instantiate an instance of `URL`.

[source, text]
.createURL(String)
----
include::../src/test/java/my/sample/SharedMethods.java[lines=18..25]
----

At the statement (11) we get access to the URL. We will effectively download a PNG image file from the URL and obtain a large array of bytes.
The `downloadURL(URL)` method of `SharedMethods` class implements this processing: converting a URL to an array of bytes.

[source,text]
.downloadUrl(URL)
----
include::../src/test/java/my/sample/SharedMethods.java[lines=26..44]
----

The statement (12) invokes `store.write()` method, which create a new file tree, as this:

image::../images/tutorial/07_writing_image_with_metadata.png[]

=== Metadata attributes based on key-value pairs explicitly specified, plus attributes based on a URL

the `index` file contains a single line of text, which is something like:

[source,text]
.index
----
27b2d39436d0655e7e8885c7f2a568a646164280	png	{"label":"red apple", "step":"01", "URL.host":"kazurayam.github.io", "URL.path":"/materialstore-tutorial/images/tutorial/03_apple.png", "URL.port":"80", "URL.protocol":"https"}
----


Please find a JSON-like string enclosed by a pair of curly braces (`{` and `}`). I call this section as **Metadata** of a material.  The Metadata contains several **"key":"value"** pairs. The metadata was created as specified by the line (13).

[source,text]
----
        Metadata.builder(url)           // (13)
                .put("step", "01")
                .put("label", "red apple")
                .build(),
----

The `url` variable contains an instance of `java.net.URL` class. You should check the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URL.html[Javadoc of `URL`]. The constructor `new URL(String spec)` can accept a string like "https://kazurayam.github.io/materialstore/images/tutorial/03_apple.png[]" and parse it into its lexical components: `protocol`, `host`, `port`, `path`, `query` and `fragment`. The `url` variable passed to the `Metadata.builder(url)` call is parsed by the URL class and transformed into a set of key-value pairs like `"URL.hostname": "kazurayam.github.io"`.

Let me show you a few more examples.

The URL string
`"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=materialstore+kazurayam&atb=v314-1&ia=images"` will make the following Metadata instance:

[source]
----
{"URL.host":"duckduckgo.com", "URL.path":"/", "URL.port":"80", "URL.protocol":"https", "URL.query":"q=materialstore+kazurayam&atb=v314-1&ia=images"}
----

The URL string `"https://kazurayam.github.io/materialstore-tutorial/#first-sample-code-hello-materialstore"` will make the following Metadata instance:

[source]
----
{"URL.fragment":"first-sample-code-hello-materialstore", URL.host":"kazurayam.github.io", "URL.path":"/materialstore-tutorial", "URL.port":"80", "URL.protocol":"https"}
----

=== Order of key-value pairs in Metadata

the key-value pairs in the pair of curly braces (`{` .. `}`) are arranged by the "key". Unless explicitly specified, the "keys" are sorted by the ascending order as string. Therefore, in the above example, the key `URL.fragment` comes first, the key "URL.protocol" comes last.

=== key:value pairs explicitly specified

The line (13) explicitly created 2 pairs of *key:value*, that is `"step": "01"` and `"label":"red apple"`.

You can create *key:value* pairs as many as you want. Both of key and value must be String type. No number, no boolean values are allowed. The *key* can be any string, the *value* can be any string as well. You can use any characters including `/` (forward slash), `\` (back slash), `:` (colon). You can use non-ASCII characters. For example: you can create a key-value pair `"番号": "123/456 xyz"`. The Character escaping rule of JSON applies here: a double quote character `"` will be escaped to `\"`; a back-slash character `\` will be escaped to be `\\`.

Metadata is stored in the `index` file, which is apart from the material file itself. The byte array downloaded from a URL is not altered at all. The byte array is saved into a file in the `objects` directory as is. And then, you can associate a Metadata to each individual materials. What sort of Metadata to associate? --- it is completely up to you.

Metadata plays an important role later when you start compiling advanced reports "Chronos Diff" and "Twins Diff".

=== Retrieving information of a Material

The line (14) prints the summarized information of the material: the ID, the FileType, and the Metadata.

You can also get various information out of the `material` variable. For example, the line (15) retrieves the value of `"URL.host"` out of the material object, compares it with an expected value.

[source,text]
----
        assertEquals("kazurayam.github.io",
                material.getMetadata().get("URL.host"));        // (15)
