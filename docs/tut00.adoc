This document describes two Java libraries: `materialstore` and `inspectus` that I developed.

== Setting up a project

Here I assume you have a seasoned programming skill in Java, and you have installed the build tool link:https://gradle.org/install/[Gradle]. Now let us create a project where you write some Java code for practice.

I created a working directory under my home directory: `~/tmp/sampleProject`.

[source, shell]
----
$ cd ~/tmp/
$ mkdir sampleProject
----

You want to initialize it as a Gradle project, so you would operate in the console as this:

[source, shell]
----
$ cd ~/tmp/sampleProject
$ gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 1

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may change in the next minor release)? (default

Project name (default: sampleProject):

> Task :init

Then you will find a file `sampleProject/settings.gradle` has been created, which looks like:

[source, gradle]
.settings.gradle
----
rootProject.name = 'sampleProject'
----

You will also find a file `sampleProject/build.gradle` file, but it will be empty (comments only). So you want to edit it, like this.

[source, gradle]
.build.gradle
----
include::../build.gradle[lines=1..24]
