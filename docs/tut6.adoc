We are going to read the code of

Once you saved several screenshots into the store, you would frequently want to review them. You would want to look the images associated with various metadata. The following code shows how to compile an HTML that renders 3 PNG images with metadata.

Running this JUnit5 test will result a new file tree at `build/tmp/testOutput/my.sample.T06MaterialListReportTest/`. It will look somehting like this:

The top page shows a list of Materials.

You can click one of the rows to open it. When opened, you can see the PNG image is rendered.

The report HTML file is created immediately under the `store` directory, and the file name will be in the format of `store/<JobName>-<JobTimestamp>.html`. The location and the file name is fixed. You should not try to change it; you would not need to do so.
