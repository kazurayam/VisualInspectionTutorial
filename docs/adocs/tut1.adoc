This is a quick introduction to a Java library named `materialstore` that I (kazurayam) developed.

== Setting up a project

Here I assume you have a seasoned programming skill in Java, and you have installed the build tool link:https://gradle.org/install/[Gradle]. Now let us create a project where you write some Java code for practice.

I created a working directory under my home directory: `~/tmp/sampleProject`.

[source, shell]
----
$ cd ~/tmp/
$ mkdir sampleProject
----

You want to initialize it as a Gradle project, so you would operate in the console as this:

[source, shell]
----
$ cd ~/tmp/sampleProject
$ gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 1

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may change in the next minor release)? (default

Project name (default: sampleProject):

> Task :init

----

Then you will find a file `sampleProject/settings.gradle` has been created, which looks like:

[source, gradle]
.settings.gradle
----
rootProject.name = 'sampleProject'
----

You will also find a file `sampleProject/build.gradle` file, but it will be empty (comments only). So you want to edit it, like this.

[source, gradle]
.build.gradle
----
include::../../build.gradle[lines=1..30]
----

Please note that in the build.gradle we declared the dependency to the `materialstore` library, which is published at the Maven Central repository.

* https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.kazurayam/materialstore

You can check if the project is properly setup by executing a command, as follows:

[source]
----
$ cd ~/tmp/sampleProject/
$ gradle dependencies --configuration testImplementation

> Task :dependencies

------------------------------------------------------------
Root project 'materialstore-tutorial'
------------------------------------------------------------

== 1st example : "Hello, materialstore!"

I have created a JUnit-based Java code that uses the materialstore library: `sampleProject/src/test/java/my/sample/T1HelloMaterialstoreTest.java`, as follows:

[source, java]
.T01HelloMaterialstoreTest.java
----
include::../../src/test/java/my/sample/T01HelloMaterialstoreTest.java[]
----

You can run this by running the `test` task of Gradle:

[source]
----
$ gradle test --tests  my.sample.T1HelloMaterialstore -i
> Task :compileJava NO-SOURCE
> Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :classes UP-TO-DATE
> Task :compileTestJava
> Task :processTestResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :testClasses
> Task :test

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
----

The `test` task of Gradle will create a report in HTML format where you can find all output from the test execution. You can find the report at `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.

[sorc,text]
----
$ cd ~/tmp/sampleProject
$ tree build/reports/tests/
build/reports/tests/
└── test
    ├── classes
    │   └── my.sample.T1HelloMaterialstoreTest.html

    │   └── report.js
    └── packages
        └── my.sample.html

5 directories, 6 files
----

You want to open the `index.html` in your Web browser to have a look at the test result.

=== File tree created by "Hello, materialstore"

The 1st test will create a new file tree as output:

image:../images/tutorial/02_test_output_file_tree.png[]

Let us read the Java source of the test `T1HelloMaterialstoreTest` line by line to understand the basic concept and classes of the "materialstore" library. Here I assume that you are a well-trained Java programmer who requires no explanation how to code this using JUnit.

=== Create a base directory

[source, text]
----
import java.nio.file.Path;
...
    @BeforeEach
    public void beforeEach() {
        Path dir = createTestClassOutputDir(this);   // (1)
----

The statement commented as (1) creates a directory `build/tmp/testOutput/<fully qualified class name>`. In this directory the test will save all output files during its run. The helper method `createTestClassOutputDir(Object)` is defined later in the source file.

=== Create the "store" directory

[source, text]
----
        Path storeDir = dir.resolve("store");   // (2)
----

The statement (2) declares an instance of `java.nio.file.Path` class, store it into a variable `storeDir`. The Path object corresponds to the directory `build/tmp/testOutput/<fully qualified class name>/store`.

=== Store class

[source, text]
----
import com.kazurayam.materialstore.core.Store;
...

    private Store store;
...

        store = Stores.newInstance(storeDir);        // (3)
----

The statement (3) creates an instance of `com.kazurayam.materialstore.core.Store` class. The statement (3) will create a physical directory `store` if not yet present.

The `Store` class is the core part of the materialstore library. The `Store` class implements methods to write the materials into the OS file system. It also implements methods to select (=retrieve) one or more `Material` object(s) (=file) out of the store.

The `Stores` class is the factory that is capable of creating instance of the `Store` class.

=== JobName class

[source,text]
----
import com.kazurayam.materialstore.core.JobName;
...
    @Test
    public void test01_hello_materialstore() throws MaterialstoreException {
        JobName jobName =
                new JobName("test01_hello_materialstore");       // (4)
----

The statement (4) declares the name of a subdirectory under the `store` directory. You can specify a string value as the parameter to the constructor of `com.kazurayam.materialstore.core.JobName` class. It is just a directory name; no deep semantic meaning is enforced. However, you should remember that some ASCII characters are prohibited as a part of file/directory names by the underlying OS; therefore you can not use them as the `JobName` object's value. For example, Windows OS does not allow you to use the following characters:

* `<` (less than)
* `>` (greater than)
* `:` (colon)
* `"` (double quote)
* `/` (forward slash)
* `\` (backslash)
* `|` (vertical bar or pipe)
* `?` (question mark)
* `*` (asterisk)

You can use non-latin characters as JobName. JobName can contain white spaces if necessary. For example, you can write:

[source, text]
----
    JobName jobName = new JobName("わたしの仕事 means my job");
----

=== JobTimestamp class

[source, text]
----
import com.kazurayam.materialstore.core.JobTimestamp;
...
        JobTimestamp jobTimestamp = JobTimestamp.now();          // (5)
----

The statement (5) declares the name of a new directory, which I will call as *JobTimestamp*, under a *JobName* directory. The JobTimestamp will be in a fixed format of `uuuuMMdd_hhmmss` (year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds). A call to `JobTimestamp.now()` will return a JobTimestamp object which corresponds to a directory of which name stands for the current timestamp provided by OS.

The `JobTimestamp` class implements various methods that help you work on. See the link:https://kazurayam.github.io/materialstore/api/com/kazurayam/materialstore/core/JobTimestamp.html[javadoc] for detail.


=== create a file tree, write a "Material"

[source,text]
----
import com.kazurayam.materialstore.core.FileType;
import com.kazurayam.materialstore.core.Material;
import com.kazurayam.materialstore.core.Metadata;
...
        String text = "Hello, materialstore!";
        Material material = store.write(jobName, jobTimestamp,   // (6)
                FileType.TXT,                            // (7)
                Metadata.NULL_OBJECT,                    // (8)
                text);                                   // (9)
----

The lines (6) to (9) creates a file tree under the `store`directory, like this:

[source, text]
----
$ cd build/tmp/testOutput/my.sample.T1HelloMaterialstoreTest/
$ tree .
store/
└── test01_hello_materialstore
    └── 20221128_082216
        ├── index
        └── objects
            └── 4eb4efec3324a630e0d3d96e355261da638c8285.txt
----

The structure of the file tree under the `store` directory is specially designed to save the *Materials*. The tree structure is fixed: a file named `store/<JobName>/<JobTimestamp>/index` plus one or more files under the `store/<JobName>/<JobTimestamp>/objects/` directory. You are not suppose to *customize* this tructure. You would delegate all tasks of creating + naming + locating files and directories under the `store` directory to the `Store` object.

As the line commented as (6) tells, a "Material" (actually, is a file) is always saved under the sub-tree `store/<JobName>/<JobTimestamp>/objects`.

=== File name of the Materials

All files under the `objects` have a fixed format of file name, that is:

*<40 characters in alpha-numeric, calcurated by the SHA1 hash function>.<file extention>*

for example, a Material could have a file name:

`4eb4efec3324a630e0d3d96e355261da638c8285.txt`

Ths `Store#write()` method call produces the leading 40 characters using the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1[SHA1] message digest function taking the byte array of the file content as the input. This cryptic 40 characters uniquely identifies the input files regardless which type of the file content: a plain text, CSV, HTML, JSON, XML, PNG image, PDF, zipped archive, MS Excel xlsx, etc. This 40 characters is called as `ID` of a Material.

*You are not supposed to specify the name on the file in the materialstore. The ID of a Material is calculated based on the file content by the `Store` class. A single byte change in the file content will result a completely different value of the `ID`.*

=== FileType

The line (7) specifies `FileType.TXT`.

[source, text]
----
                FileType.TXT,                            // (7)
----

(7) assigns a file extension `txt` to the file name. The `com.kazurayam.materialstore.FileType` enum declares many concrete FileType instances ready to use. See
link:https://kazurayam.github.io/materialstore/api/com/kazurayam/materialstore/core/FileType.html[`com.kazurayam.materialstore.core.FileType`] for the complete list. You can also create your own class that implements `com.kazurayam.materialstore.IFileType`. See link:https://kazurayam.github.io/materialstore/api/com/kazurayam/materialstore/core/IFileType.html[]. You can use your custom FileType wherever a FileType enum is accepted.

=== Metadata

You can associate various metadata to each Material instances. The URL string (e.g., "https://www.google.com/?q=selenium") is a typical metadata of a screenshot of a web page.

The `T01HelloMaterialstoreTest` does not really make use of the Metadata. So, I wrote `Metadata.NULL_OBJECT` to fill the required parameter.

[source,text]
----
                Metadata.NULL_OBJECT,                (8)
----

I will cover how to make full use of Metadata later.

=== Types of objects writeable into the Store

The javadoc of the link:https://kazurayam.github.io/materialstore/api/com/kazurayam/materialstore/core/filesystem/Store.html[`Store`] shows that it can accept multiple types of object as input to write into the `store`:

* `java.lang.String`
* `byte[]`
* `java.nio.file.Path`
* `java.io.File`
* `java.awt.image.BufferedImage`

These types will cover the most cases in your automated UI testing.
